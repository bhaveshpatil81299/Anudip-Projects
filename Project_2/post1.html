<p><strong>Indian team</strong> are the consistent team from tons of your time and therefore the quite <strong>captaincy</strong> yet given to players has been tremendous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best thing in <strong>Indian management</strong> has always been the very fact that subsequent captain was ready long before the prevailing one had retired.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dhoni</strong> was ready before <strong>Ganguly</strong> retired, <strong>Kohli</strong> was groomed before <strong>Dhoni</strong> retired and this tradition has continued for ages within the country. it's always clear that who subsequent captain goes to be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Captaining from <strong>CK Nayudu to Ajinkya Rahane</strong>, Men in Blue has <strong>24 captain in ODI</strong> and <strong>33 in Tests</strong> respectively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be it any format of the sport , India have always produced legendary captains. Captains like <strong>Kapil Dev, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sourav Ganguly, Virat Kohli</strong> are legends who made team to succeed in at subsequent apex level.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The impact of Indian captains on world cricket are often understood by the very fact that the captains of <strong>ICC’s ODI, Test, and T20 teams</strong> of the last decade are Indians. While MS Dhoni is that the captain of the limited-overs squad, Kohli was hauled with the captaincy of the Test team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>India are currently alright settled with <strong>Virat Kohli</strong> leading the squad altogether the three formats of the sport , and <strong>Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane</strong> to back him up. But, the 2023 World Cup would probably be the last mega event for the Indian skipper Virat Kohli and his companions Rohit and Rahane.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If talking about future cause, team should get that captain who could play an equivalent responsibilities what yet has been skilled . I even have brought 5 names, who i feel could lead on India within the future.</p>
